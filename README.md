Place the `gotr/` direcetory (found in `src/`) in your gajim's `plugins`
directory. This is usually found at one of the following locations:

    $PREFIX/share/gajim/plugins/
    $HOME/.local/share/gajim/plugins/

with $PREFIX being usually `/usr` or `/usr/local`.

After installing, the plugin must be manually enabled in the Gajim plugin
